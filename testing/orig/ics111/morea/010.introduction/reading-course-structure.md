## ICS 111 Course Overview

### Instructor:

Carleton (Cam) Moore<br>
Office: POST 307B.<br>
Hours: M - F, 10am to 11am or by appointment.<br>
Email: cmoore@hawaii.edu (Please include ICS111 or ICS 111 in the email subject)

### Meeting Times

**Lecture:** Tuesdays and Thursdays 12:00pm - 01:15pm in Holmes Hall 247

**Lab:** Wednesdays and Fridays 12:00pm - 01:15pm in POST 318A

### Goals

In this course, students will:

* Learn how to translate problems to algorithms to code.
* Learn basics of programming with a modern programming language, such as Java.
* Apply principles to development of running program codes that involve the use of computer graphics, interaction and sound.

Learning to program in Java is only one of the goals for this course, but may be the most important: fluency in Java is needed to apply many of the other tools and information presented in this course as well as in subsequent ICS courses. The homework and exams assume students are comfortable programming in Java at the level required for this course. Students who are not comfortable with programming, as determined either by individual difficulty or by lack of overall success on homework assignments, should consult with the TAs or instructor for additional (optional) assignments to help them come up to speed.

### Flipped class

This class is a 'flipped' class. The learning materials are on this website. Do the assigned readings and watch the screen casts. There will be few if any lectures during the class meetings. Instead, we will meet Tuesdays and Thursdays 12:00pm - 01:55pm in Holmes Hall 247 to take quizzes to evaluate your understanding of the Module's materials.  I will give you  a short quiz, less than 10 minutes.  The quiz will ask you to answer a few questions or write a short program or snippet of code.  You'll turn in your quiz to me and I'll take a few minutes to review your answers then go over the quiz showing you how I would approach the problem and give feedback on the errors that I saw in your quizzes.  I will grade the quiz with a score of

 * 10 - Exceptional,
 * 9 - Successful,
 * 8 - Borderline or
 * 7 - Unsuccessful.

After the quiz I will give you a programming problem that you and a partner will solve using pencil and paper.  You will break down the problem into steps and draw a flow chart or list of the steps you think will solve the problem. After figuring out the steps, you will  convert them into Java or pseudo code. 

The lab for this class meets Wednesdays and Fridays 12:00pm - 01:15pm in POST 318A. During the lab we will be using the flow chart and code developed in the lecture to implement, test, and debug your solution to the problem. We will also be solving additional problems in lab.

We will be doing a lot of problem solving in this class.  Starting from a problem description, designing a solution, then implementing and testing the solution.

### Textbook

We will be using an [Introduction to Programming Using Java, Seventh Edition](http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/index.html) and other internet resources to explain the concepts.

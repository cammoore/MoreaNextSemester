Write a *public* *static* subroutine *sayHi* that prints out 'Hello World'.

### Problem 2

Write a *public* *static* subroutine *countDown* that counts down from 100 to 0 by fives and prints the numbers as it goes.


### Problem 3

Write a *private* *static* subroutine *evenNumbers* that prints out the even numbers from 22 to 44.

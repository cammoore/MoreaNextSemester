# Practice: Dynamic Array Of Strings

**Take out a piece of paper. We'll be programming on paper.**

### Problem 1

Create a *DynamicArrayOfStrings* class. The class must have at least two instance variables:
 
  * An array to hold the Strings and
  * An int to hold the number of Strings in the Array. 

### Problem 2

Write the default constructor for the class.

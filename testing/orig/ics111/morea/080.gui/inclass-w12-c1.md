# Practice: PlayerPanel

**Take out a piece of paper. We'll be programming on paper.**

### Problem 1

Create a *PlayerPanel* class that extends *JPanel*.

The *PlayerPanel* class must have a *Player* instance variable and a highlight property. 

The *PlayerPanel* class should render the player's name and score in the panel.  When the panel is highlighted the panel should have a border.

*PlayerPanel* should have methods to update the player's score.  When the score updates the panel should repaint.

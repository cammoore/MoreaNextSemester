# Practice: Graphics Class

**Take out a piece of paper. We'll be programming on paper.**

### Problem 1

Write the *paintComponent(Graphics g)* method that creates a square at position (25, 30) with a width and height of 50 pixels.

### Problem 2

Write the same *paintComponent(Graphics g)* method using a different way of drawing the square.

### Problem 3

Write the *paintComponent(Graphics g)* that creates a square with a width and height of 50 pixels in the center of the component.  How do you find the width and height of a component?

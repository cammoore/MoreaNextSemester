Demonstrate basic problem solving skills: analyzing problems, modeling a problem as a system of objects, creating algorithms, and implementing models and algorithms in an object-oriented computer language (classes, objects, methods with parameters, abstract classes, interfaces, inheritance and polymorphism).

The student will:

* Be able to deconstruct problems into models, to develop algorithms, and to implement the models and algorithms in program code.

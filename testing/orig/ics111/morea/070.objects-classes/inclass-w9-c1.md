# Practice: Classes

**Take out a piece of paper. We'll be programming on paper.**

### Problem 1

Create a *Player* class that has two *instance variables*:

  * *name* a String
  
  * *score* an int
  
The *instance variables* must be *private*. This means you need *accessor* methods.  The *Player*'s name should be read-only. You can't change their name after the *Player* instance is created.


### Problem 2

Write a subroutine that asks the user how many players to create.  The subroutine should create an array of *Player*s of the right size then ask the user for the player's names and create the *PLayer* instances.

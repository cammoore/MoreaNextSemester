## Q18: More Classes

### Take out a piece of paper and put your name on the upper right corner.

For this problem, you should write a very simple but complete class. The class represents a counter that counts up or down starting at 0. 

* The name of the class should be *Counter*. 
* It has one private instance variable representing the value of the counter. 
* It has three instance methods: 

  * *increment()* adds one to the counter value,
  * *decrement()* subtracts one from the counter value, and
  * *getValue()* returns the current counter value. 
  
  
Write a complete definition for the class, *Counter*.


Finish your class before the timer runs out.

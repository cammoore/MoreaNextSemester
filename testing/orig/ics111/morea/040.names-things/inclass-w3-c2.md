# Practice: Division and Modulus

**Take out a piece of paper. We'll be programming on paper.**

**For the following programming questions, I'd like you to follow the programming algorithm.**

1) Read and understand the problem
  
2) Create the comment stating the problem.
  
3) Insert the Java boilerplate.
  
{% highlight java %}
/** Program that ...
 * @author Cam Moore
 */
public class ProgramName {
  /** Does something.
   * @param args the command line arguments.
   */
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}
   
4) Write the steps in pseudo code.
  
5) Refine the pseudo code.
  
  
### Problem 1

Write a program that prints out the quotient and remainder of 7 divided by 4.

### Problem 2

Write a program that asks for a number between 1 and 100, then prints the remainder of that number divided by 3.

### Problem 3

Write a program that asks for two number between 1 and 10, then prints the first number divided by the second.

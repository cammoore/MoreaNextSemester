## Q09: Branching

* Take out a piece of paper and put your name on the upper right corner.

* Answer the following questions:

  1. Write a program that asks the user to enter an integer, read the user's response, and tell the user whether the number entered is even or odd. (You can use TextIO.getInt() to read the integer. Recall that an integer n is even if n % 2 == 0.)
  
  2. Evaluate the following expressions:
  
{% highlight java %}

int x = 30 + 20 / 5 * 2 - 2;

double z = (30 + (20 / 5)) * 2 - 2;

{% endhighlight %}

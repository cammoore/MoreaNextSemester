# Practice: More Looping

**Take out a piece of paper. We'll be programming on paper.**

**For the following programming questions, I'd like you to follow the programming algorithm.**

1) Read and understand the problem
  
2) Create the comment stating the problem.
  
3) Insert the Java boilerplate.
  
{% highlight java %}
/** Program that ...
 * @author Cam Moore
 */
public class ProgramName {
  /** Does something.
   * @param args the command line arguments.
   */
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}
   
4) Write the steps in pseudo code.
  
5) Refine the pseudo code.
  
  
### Problem 1

Write a program that asks the user to enter floating point numbers between 1 and 100 and calculates the average of the numbers.  When the user enters a number out of the range the program should calculate the average and stop. 

### Problem 2

Write a program that counts down from 100 to 0 by fives and prints the numbers as it goes.

### Problem 3

Write a program that prints out the even numbers from 22 to 44. Do not use any branching statements.

# Practice: Branching

**Take out a piece of paper. We'll be programming on paper.**

**For the following programming questions, I'd like you to follow the programming algorithm.**

1) Read and understand the problem
  
2) Create the comment stating the problem.
  
3) Insert the Java boilerplate.
  
{% highlight java %}
/** Program that ...
 * @author Cam Moore
 */
public class ProgramName {
  /** Does something.
   * @param args the command line arguments.
   */
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}
   
4) Write the steps in pseudo code.
  
5) Refine the pseudo code.
  
  
### Problem 1

Write a program that counts from 10 to 30 by three and outputs the number if it is a multiple of four.

### Problem 2

Write a program to play Jan Ken Po or Rock Paper Scissors.  The computer should choose a random value then ask the user to choose. Then print out who wins.

### Problem 3

Write a program that counts from 1 to 100, if the number is a multiple of 3 it should output "fizz", if the number is a multiple of 5 it should output "buzz".


## Show me your code before you leave

### Practice Expressions

{% highlight java %}
int x = 30 + (20 / 5 * 2 - 2);

int y = 30 + 20 / 5 % 2 - 2;

int z = ((30 + 20) / 5) % (2 + 1);
{% endhighlight %}

# Practice: Heaps

**Take out a piece of paper.**

### 1 Create a min heap of ints stored in an array by inserting in sequence the values 22, 63, 20, 15, 23, 80, 103, 48.

### 2 Remove the two smallest values from the heap and add them together.

### 3 Add the sum to the heap.

### 4 Show me the resulting heap as an array.

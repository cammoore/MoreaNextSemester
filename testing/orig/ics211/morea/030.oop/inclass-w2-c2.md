# Practice: Inheritance

**Take out a piece of paper. We'll be programming on paper.**

### Problem 1

* Create a class hierarchy of Vehicles. There should be a base class **Vehicle** and at least two sub-classes, **Automobile** and **Truck**.

  * The base class should have the following member variables:
  
    * String VIN
    * Double weight


  * What are some of the other properties/member variables in your class hierarchy?

### Problem 2

* Answer the following questions about your class hierarchy.

  * What is the visibility of the base class member variables? Why?
  
  * What are the base class member variables?
  
  * What are the sub-class member variables?
  
  * What are some other options or organizations for this class hierarchy?

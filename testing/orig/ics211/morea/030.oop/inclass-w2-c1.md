# Practice: Designing classes

**Take out a piece of paper. We'll be programming on paper.**

### Problem 1

* **Write a simple Java class representing a UH Course.**

  * The class must have the following member variables:

    * Integer CRN
    * String courseName
    * Integer section
    * String title
    * Integer credits

### Problem 2

* **Answer the following questions about your class.**

  * What is the visibility of your member variables?
  
  * What should the visibility be?
  
  * What does the constructor look like?
  
  * Can you change the values of the UH Course?

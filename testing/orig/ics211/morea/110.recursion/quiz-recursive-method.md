## Q16: Recursive method

**Take out a piece of paper and put your name on the upper right corner.**

### Write a recursive method that takes as parameters a String s and an int i and returns a String that has *s* repeated *i* times. 

    For example, if the given string is "Go Bows! " and the integer is 3 then the return value would be "Go Bows! Go Bows! Go Bows! ". 
    
    
*(Note that if the integer is 0, then the empty string "" should be returned.)*

* Be sure to write JavaDoc comments for your code.

* Conduct a quick review of your code, before you are done.

* **Bonus point:** implement the ArrayStack's *E peek()* method.

* Hand in your code when you are done.

# Q17: Recursive toString Quiz

Take out a piece of paper and put your name on the upper right corner.

* **Implement a recursive toString() method for a LinkedList.**

{% highlight java %}
public class LinkedList<E> {
  private LinkedNode<E> head;
  int size;

  public String toString() {
   // your code
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

* You may use a recursive helper method.

* Be sure to write JavaDoc comments for your code.

* Conduct a quick review of your code, before you are done.

* **Bonus point:** implement the *void insertionSort(E[] data, Comparator&lt;E&gt; c)* method.

* Hand in your code when you are done.

Select the appropriate searching or sorting algorithm based on the algorithmâ€™s behavior.


The student will:

* Compare different searching algorithms based upon their behavior.

* Compare different sorting algortithms based upon their behaivor.

* Select the correct algorithm for a given programming problem.

* Implement the searching and sorting algorithms.

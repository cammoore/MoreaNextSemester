# IC02: Array add method


**Step 1** 30 minutes.

* Form teams of two.
* Introduce yourself to your partner.
* Take out a piece of paper, put put both your names on the top right of the paper.

* **Write a Class that has a static method that adds an item to an array.**

{% highlight java %}
public static boolean add(E[] array, E item);
{% endhighlight %}

  **Hint:** You can assume that the first place in the array that has a null is the end.

* Be sure to write JavaDoc comments for your code.

<script src="countdown.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

<!-- =========================================================== -->
<script type="application/javascript">
var myCountdown2 = new Countdown({
									time: 25 * 60,
									width:150,
									height:80,
									rangeHi:"minute"	// <- no comma on last item!
									});

</script>

**Step 2**

Introduce yourself to your neighbor team, then switch papers. You will review your neighbor team's program. Put your names underneath the other team's names. Below the program note any errors in the code and at least one good thing about the code.

### Goals

In this course, students will:

* Learn and implement standard data structures, including linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, and binary trees.
* Learn and implement standard algorithms for sorting and searching and tree traversal
* Learn and use the basics of algorithm analysis and complexity, including big-O notation
* Be exposed to software engineering techniques such as: abstract data types, separation of definition and implementation, encapsulation, information hiding, testing and code reviews.
* Learn and use object oriented programming in Java by designing, implementing, reviewing and testing solutions to problems
* Learn to write algebraic equations in prefix, infix and postfix notation using preorder, inorder and postorder traversals

Learning to program in Java is only one of the goals for this course, but may be the most important: fluency in Java is needed to apply many of the other tools and information presented in this course as well as in subsequent ICS courses. The homeworks and exams assume students are comfortable programming in Java at the level required for this course. Students who are not comfortable with programming, as determined either by individual difficulty or by lack of overall success on homework assignments, should consult with the TAs or instructor for additional (optional) assignments to help them come up to speed.

### Flipped class

This class is a 'flipped' class. The learning materials are on this website. Read the Text and watch the screen casts. There will not be any lectures during the class meetings. We will meet Mondays and Wednesdays 10:30 - 11:45am in Marine Sciences Building 114 to take quizzes to evaluate your understanding of the Module's materials.  I will give you  a short quiz, about 25 minutes.  The quiz will ask you to answer a few questions or write a short program or snippet of code.  You'll turn in your quiz to me and I'll take a few minutes to review your answers then go over the quiz showing you how I would approach the problem and give feedback on the errors that I saw in your quizzes.  I will grade the quiz with a score of

 * 10 - Exceptional,
 * 9 - Successful,
 * 8 - Borderline or
 * 7 - Unsuccessful.

Attendance is not required, **However** the daily quizzes are worth 15% of you final grade. If you do not turn in a quiz you get 0 points.

The lab for this class meets:

  * for Section 1, Tuesdays and Thursdays 03:00p-04:15p in POST 319.
  * for Section 2, Tuesdays and Thursdays 06:30p-07:45p in POST 318A.
  * for Section 3, Tuesdays and Thursdays 06:30p-07:45p in POST 319.

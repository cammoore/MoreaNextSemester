**Take out a piece of paper.**

### 1 Insert the following names into an Open Addressed Hashtable with linear probing. The table has a size of 5.

| Name&nbsp;&nbsp; | hashCode()&nbsp;&nbsp; | hashCode() % 5&nbsp;&nbsp; | hashCode() % 11&nbsp;&nbsp; |
|:----------------:|:----------------------:|:--------------------------:|:---------------------------:|
| "Tom" | 84274 | 4 | 3 |
| "Dick" | 2129869 | 4 | 5 |
| "Harry" | 69496448 | 3 | 10 |
| "Sam" | 82879 | 4 | 5 |
| "Pete" | 2484038 | 3 | 7 |


### 2 Delete "Dick" from the table.

### 3 Insert the same names in the same order into an Open Addressed Hashtable with linear probing. The table has a size of 11.

### 4 Delete "Dick" from the table.

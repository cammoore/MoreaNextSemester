# Q02: Java Programming Quiz:

* Take out a piece of paper and put your name on the upper right corner.

* **Write a Java program, just a class with a *main* method, that:**

  * Takes an array of strings as input and
  * Loops through the first string, printing each character as follows:

    * If the character is a vowel ("a", "e", "i", "o", "u"), it must be printed in uppercase.
    * otherwise, the entry must be printed as is.

  * Computes and prints the number of non-vowel entries at the end of the loop.

  * Be sure to write JavaDoc comments for your code.

* Hand in your code when you are done.

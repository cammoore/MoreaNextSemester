# Practice Object-oriented Analysis and Design

Your job is to write a program that simulates the customer experience at CoffeeHut.

#### CoffeeHut has a menu that lists the beverages and food it serves. Customers enter the line at CoffeeHut.  They create their order from the menu items.  When they get to the front of the line they give their order to CoffeeHut.  CoffeeHut calculates the cost of the customer's order. The customer pays CoffeeHut for the order and gives their name.  CoffeeHut then makes the customer's order.  When the order is done CoffeeHut calls the customer's name and the customer picks up their order.

### Object-oriented Analysis and Design

* List the nouns in the problem statement.  These are candidates for the classes.
 
* List the verbs in the problem statement.  These are candidates for the methods.  

  * The subject of the sentence might be the class that has that method. 
  
  * Direct objects might be the parameters of the method.

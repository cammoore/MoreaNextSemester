# Practice: ArrayList

**Take out a piece of paper. We'll be programming on paper.**

### Problem 1

* **Write a Generic Java class ArrayList&lt;E&gt;:**

{% highlight java %}
public class ArrayList<E> implements List211<E> {
  /** Holds the items in the list. */
  private E[] data;
  /** The size of the list. */
  private int size;

  // Your code goes here.
    
}
{% endhighlight %}

* Be sure to write JavaDoc comments for your code.

### Problem 2

* **Answer the following questions:**

  * When do you need to resize **data**?
  
  * Why do we keep track of **size**?

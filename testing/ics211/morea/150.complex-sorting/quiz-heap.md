# Q23: Create a heap in an array.

Take out a piece of paper and put your name on the upper right corner.

* **Create a max heap (stored in an array)** by inserting, in sequence, the values 7, 1, 4, 5, 6, 3, 8. Show the resulting array.

* After the array, write an explanation the Big-O performance of creating the heap.

* After the Big-O analysis write the formulas for:
 
   1 parent index given a child index,
   
   2 left child index given a parent index and
   
   3 right child index given a parent index

* **Bonus point:** Describe an in-order traversal of a binary tree.

* Hand in your paper when you are done.

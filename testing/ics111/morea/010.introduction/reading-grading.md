Class participation is encouraged. Comments and questions are particularly helpful to the instructor and generally to the class. If needed to encourage class participation, the instructor may call on students to answer specific questions or contribute opinions. Participation in class should be friendly, relaxed, and mutually respectful.

### Cheating

In general, cheating means presenting the work of somebody else as one's own, or providing one's work to somebody else to help them cheat.

In the past, TAs have detected cheating on homeworks. Don't do it!!!

**No Cheating Policy:** any cheating will result in a grade of 0 for the assignment or exam the first time it is detected, and a grade of F for the course for any subsequent instance. Any instance of cheating will also be recorded in the student's ICS department file, and may be reported to the office of the Dean of Students, possibly resulting in disciplinary action against the student.

The [Student Conduct Code](http://studentaffairs.manoa.hawaii.edu/policies/conduct_code/system_scc.php) has more details on both impermissible behavior (see for example section IV.B.1 of the policies, Acts of dishonesty) and possible disciplinary sanctions.

If you have any questions, please contact the instructor or the TA.

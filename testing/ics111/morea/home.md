The University of Hawaii, Manoa Course Catalog describes ICS 111 as an "*Overview of computer science, writing programs.*"   

This course will give you an overview of / introduction to the fundamentals of computer science emphasizing problem solving, algorithm development, implementation, and debugging/testing of programs in an Object Oriented Language (Java).

**Prerequisites:** None

**Recommended:** Computer experience.

**Computer Requirements:** You should have have the following computer technology:

* A laptop computer, less than two years old, with at least a 15 inch screen and 10 GB of available disk space.

_All students wishing to enroll in ICS courses above 111 except ICS 141 must meet the prerequisite grade requirement of B or higher in ICS 111 prior to registering for the course._


## Objectives

* Learn how to translate problems to algorithms to code.
* Learn basics of programming with a modern programming language, such as Java, Python, etc.
* Apply principles to development of running program codes that involve the use of computer graphics, interaction and sound.
* Provide projects that require the development of codes relevant to modern use of computers- ability to parse data, store data, develop capability to control graphics, sound and interactivity.

The [Course Syllabus](morea/010.introduction/reading-syllabus.html) has more information about the course.

## Pedagogy

ICS 111 is structured as a set of [modules](modules). Each module has the following structure:

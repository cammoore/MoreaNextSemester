# Practice: Starting Programming

* Take out a piece of paper. We'll be programming on paper.

* For the following programming questions, I'd like you to follow the programming algorithm.

  1. Read and understand the problem
  
  2. Create the comment stating the problem.
  
  3. Insert the Java boilerplate.
   
  4. Write the steps in pseudo code.
  
  5. Refine the pseudo code.
  
  
  
### Problem 1

Write a program that prints out "Hello World".

### Problem 2

Write a program that prints out the following multiplication table:

| | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|-|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| 2 | 2 | 4 | 6 |
| 3 | 3 | 6 | 9 |


### Problem 3

Write a program that prints out the programming algorithm.

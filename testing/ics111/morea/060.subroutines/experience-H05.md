# ICS 111 Homework Assignment H05: Simulate a pair of dice.

1) Write a program that simulates rolling a pair of dice. The program will output a table similar to the following:

    Average number of tries: 
     # : tries
     2 : 40.30
     3 : 18.80
     4 : 12.29
     5 : 9.11
     6 : 7.10
     7 : 7.19
     8 : 7.44
     9 : 10.69
    10 : 10.79
    11 : 19.50
    12 : 34.25

The program should have a function that return the number of times it takes to roll two six sided dice to get the given number. To calculate the average number of tries your program should call the function several times and sum up the number of tries. Then divide by the number of times the function was called.

2) **Bonus** Modify your program to have a member variable that stores the number of sides of the dice.  Note: This will change the output.

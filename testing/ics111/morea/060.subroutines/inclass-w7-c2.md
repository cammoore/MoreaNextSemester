# Practice: Subroutines

**Take out a piece of paper. We'll be programming on paper.**

Write Java code for the following problems.

### Problem 1

Write a *public* *static* subroutine *getString* that asks the user to enter a hexidecimal String. Then uses *getHexValue* to convert that String to an *int*.

### Problem 2

Write a *public* *static* subroutine that calls *public static int playGame(int num)* and calculates the average score. The subroutine should take two *int* parameters *num* and *numberOfGames*.  *numberOfGames* is the number of time to call *playGame*.

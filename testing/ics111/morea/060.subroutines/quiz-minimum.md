## Q14: Subroutines

* Take out a piece of paper and put your name on the upper right corner.

* Write a subroutine with one parameter, an array of *ints*. The subroutine should return the minimum value in the array.

**Hint:** Arrays have a property called *length* which returns the length of the array.

{% highlight java %}
int[] arr = { 12, 4, 6, 8 };  // arr.length is equal to four
{% endhighlight %}

Finish your answers before the timer runs out.

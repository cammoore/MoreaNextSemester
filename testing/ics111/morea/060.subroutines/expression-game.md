# Expression Game

I will hand out three index cards to each student a blue card, a white card and a yellow card.


## Rules

### 1. When you see the Java expression you have 10 seconds to evaluate the expression then raise the index card that indicates the right answer.

### 2. If you get the right answer put a check mark on the index card.  If you didn't get the right answer don't put a check mark on the card.

### 3. We will go over the solution to the expression after the 10 seconds.

### 4. We are using the honor system, so please don't cheat.

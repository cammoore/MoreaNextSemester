# Practice: Dynamic Array Of Strings

**Take out a piece of paper. We'll be programming on paper.**

### Problem 1

Write a method *multiply* that takes a two dimensional array of ints and an int.  The methods should return a two dimensional array that is the original array multiplied by the int.

### Problem 2

Write a method *transpose* that takes a two dimensional array of doubles and returns the transposed matrix.

|[ [ 1, | 2 ]|
| &nbsp;&nbsp;[ 3, | 4 ]|
| &nbsp;&nbsp;[ 5, | 6 ] ]|


Transposes into

|[ [ 1, | 3, | 5 ]|
| &nbsp;&nbsp;[ 2, | 4, | 6 ] ]|

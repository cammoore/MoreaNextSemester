# ICS 111 Homework Assignment H03: Simulate a pair of six sided dice


1) How many times do you have to roll a pair of six sided dice before they come up seven? You could do the experiment by rolling the dice by hand. Write a computer program that simulates the experiment. The program should report the number of rolls that it makes before the dice come up seven. 

The text's Exercise 2.2 explained how to simulate rolling a pair of dice.

2) Modify the program to ask the user for a number between 2 and 12, then run the simulation counting the rolls before the dice come up with the user's choice.

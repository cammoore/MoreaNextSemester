# ICS 111 Homework Assignment H10: Graphical Two Dice Pig

1) Modify your solution to [H07](../070.objects-classes/experience-H07.html) and [H09](experience-H09.html) to play a graphical game of Two-Dice Pig with two players.  

Your *JPanel* should have a sub-panel for each player showing their current score and a panel showing the die roll. On the bottom of the *JPanel* there should be buttons for rolling again and holding and a *JLabel* with the current turn score. The *PlayerPanel* whose turn it is should be highlighted.

Your game should look something like:

2. Ask for the number of points to determine who wins and use it.

3. Inform the players what is going on with each roll.
